# Battleship
 Simple battleship game, created with TypeScript and webpack. May not work with current versions of webpack since it was created in 2018. 
 The game is not finished, AI just randomly shoots your ships or not based on Math.Random. There was an idea for it to try finishing your ships, but the deadline was breathing down my neck.
